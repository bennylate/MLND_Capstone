From Kaggle-
Bitcoin charts for the data. The various exchange APIs, for making it difficult or unintuitive enough to get OHLC and volume data at 1-min intervals that I set out on this data scraping project. Satoshi Nakamoto and the novel core concept of the blockchain, as well as its first execution via the bitcoin protocol. I'd also like to thank viewers like you! Can't wait to see what code or insights you all have to share.

I am a lowly Ph.D. student who did this for fun in my meager spare time. If you find this data interesting and you can spare a coffee to fuel my science, send it my way and I'd be immensely grateful! - 1kmWmcQa8qN9ZrdGfdkw8EHKBgugKBRcF
